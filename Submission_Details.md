# GitHub assignment submission process

## Deadline

If not stated otherwise in class, your assignments are due at **08:00** on Thursday before the next lab class.

## Branches

Make sure all your changes are in your **master** branch.

I have a script that automatically clones the master branch of your repositories at the deadline.

## Tags

Please mark your submission with a tag. This can be done via the GitHub [web interface](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-tags/) or the [command line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).

Your tag should be the due date of your submission in a **YYYYMMDD** format. Suppose your assignment is due on Thursday, November 15th. Then the name of your tag will be 20181105.

In the terminal you would type:

```
git tag 20181105
git push --tags
```
